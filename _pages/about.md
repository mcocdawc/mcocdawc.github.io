Hi, my name is Oskar.
I am a theoretical chemist with a focus on electronic structure theory and quantum chemical methods.
My work explores the fundamental principles governing molecular systems, with applications ranging from spectroscopy to complex materials.
I am particularly interested in the development and application of multireference and/or linear-scaling methods and wave function-based approaches for accurately describing challenging electronic states.
